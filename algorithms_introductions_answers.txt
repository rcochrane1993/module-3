	Fill coffee maker with coffee beans AND water

2. UPS's VOLCANO (Volume,Location and Aircraft Network Optimiser) alogrithm which was developed jointly with MIT
is used to plan for three different groups within UPS(4-6months,2-10 years,peak season between thanksgiving and christmas)
to allocate the resources at the hands of its fleet of aircraft in america. Match.com's algorithm for finding suitable
partners made them famous, called "synapse" the algorithm uses a variety of factors based on the users information to match them with other like-minded
individuals who might be compatible, and since match has led to more dates, and relationships than any other site it must work fairly well.
Ford's assmebly line to create the model-T used a simple algorithm and division of tasks to revolutionize the way products were assembled, while not
a tech algorithm, the impact of this type of thinking was monumental.

3. I think what constitutes a good algorithm is efficiency. How can we accmomplish the most amount of work in the shortest amount of time, without comprimising
quality. This avoids unecessary steps, and divides the task into manageable sub-tasks to be completed quickly and efficiently.
