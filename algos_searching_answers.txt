1. searching through a deck of cars for the ace of spades would be an example of linear search
2. searching through a library for a book would be an exmaple of binary search
3. 7 iterations
4. 3 iterations
5. In an unsorted collection of 1 million items you would have to use linear search, since the data is unsorted, even though
we know the number of items in the collection and could find the middle index, we wouldn't be able to rule out one half of data 
or the other, so unfortunately we would have to iterate over each individual item.
6. in a sorted collection of a million items i would use a binary serach algorithm. Since the data is sorted and we know the amount
of items in the collection, we can find the middle index and rule out half of the data, continuing until we find our desired item


CODE

1.

function binarySearch(collection,value){
  let low = 0;
  let high= collection.length-1;
  let mid= Math.floor((low+high)/2);

  while (low <= high){
    mid = (low + high) /2;

    if (collection[Math.floor(mid)] > value){
      high = mid - 1;
    } else if ( collection[mid] < value){
      low = mid + 1
    } else {
      return mid
    }
  } 
  return "not found"
}

2.

function searchTank (tank,target){
  var result = null, value;
  for(var i=0; i<tank.length;i++){
    value = tank[i];
    if(value === target){
      result = i;
      break;
    }
  }
  return result
}
